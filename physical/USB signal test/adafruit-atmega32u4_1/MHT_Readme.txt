To convert the report files in this directory into a Microsoft Web Archive:

1. If the path containing the files contains any spaces in it, e.g. 'c:\documents and settings\...', then copy the contents of this directory to a path that has no spaces, e.g. 'c:\temp\mht\'.
(If there are spaces in the path when you create the archive, it will not display images when opened on another computer.)

2. Using Microsoft Internet Explorer (Version 6.0 or newer):
   - Open the .html file found in this directory.
   - Select Menu: File > Save As
   - Select the desired directory and file name
   - Save as type: 'Web Archive, single file (.mht)'.
